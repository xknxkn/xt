.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Start a new process which copies from standard input to the serial port PORT.
The parent process copies from the serial port PORT to standard output.
.PP
The new process performs some filtering on standard input: ESC and EOF cause
\fBxt\fR to exit; \fB^B\fR causes \fBxt\fR to send a line break.  For
convenience in use with different keyboards, DEL is mapped to BS, and  NL is
mapped to CR.  All other characters are transmitted unchanged.
.PP
All characters received from the serial port are copied to standard output
unchanged.
